// Removed Employee and Driver types as they are now in their respective components
// Removed all state hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) related to employees and drivers
// Removed all handler functions (fetch, add, edit, delete, toggle) related to employees and drivers
// Removed imports for components used only within the moved sections (Button, Dialog, Input, Label, Switch, Table, Loader2, Plus, Search, Trash, Edit, Link) - Note: Some might still be needed if used elsewhere on this page, but based on the provided code, they seem specific to the management sections. Let's re-add if needed.
// Removed toast import as it's handled within the components

export default function AdminPage() {
  const supabase = createClient() // Create Supabase client instance here

  // Removed all state and effect logic previously here

  // --- Render Logic ---
